<div class="text-section">
	<h3 align="left">So our relationship continued and things were going swimmingly.... Until someone decided to graduate and get a job touring with the Ringling Brothers. At the time I was extremely happy and excited for you, and that still holds true, but oh man this one really tested the strength of the relationship.
	I wasn't exactly the best communicator, and you were in a different phase of life struggling with things I could never have comprehended at the time. Not a great situation, but we were both determined to make it work and in spite of the distance and other challenges, we grew as people instead of being consumed by the pressure and letting it break us down.
	And I'm especially proud of you because quite frankly I don't think I could've lasted in your position so I'm just happy to support you in whatever way I can. And the distance hasn't been all bad, taking trips to see each other, zoom date nights, stockpiling date ideas and future plans for the next time we see each other. Every time we talk it just makes me
	that much more excited for the future. And now that our relationship has survived this I really can't think of anything we can't overcome together, or anything that wouldn't be more enjoyable with you by my side. </h3>
