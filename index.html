<div class="text-section">
	<h3 align="left">As everyone knows we first met in the circus, 
		I was the shy little Indian boy with comically long hair and you were the cute blonde girl who studied abroad, a tale as old as time.
		Even though you were quite literally the first person I ran into when joining the circus as we walked into auditions not knowing if we were even at the right place,
		it took some time for our relationship to grow. The fact that you had a boyfriend at the time didn't really help, but hey it all worked out in the long run. Pretty coincidentally too,
		as in we both got broken up with at the same time, we shared a family card game that goes by many names, and there were a few more which I unfortunately cannot recall but I'm sure you'll remind me when you read this.
		But things really fell into place once you asked me to the semi-formal, at first I thought it was a nice gesture and an opportunity to go to a dance with a cute girl for the first time, something I had not yet experienced.
		And after the fifth Cha-Cha-Slide, I knew there were sparks. Obviously I had to ask you on a date after that, but I needed to talk to you privately which is of course why I crashed my car soon after so you could drive me home.
 		We ended up deciding to have a cozy night and watch a movie together where you suggested the perfect first date option of "Parasite". We only grew closer after that and before we knew it we were inseparable, until you went to Africa of course.
		But during that time we stayed in contact and I told you I wanted to be a constant in your life. That still holds true today, and will hold true for the rest of my life. At the end of the day, no matter what happens, you can always come home to me.</h3>
