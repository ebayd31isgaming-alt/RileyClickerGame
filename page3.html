<div class="text-section">
	<h3 align="left">The past six months I've gotten to spend with you have been an absolute dream, travelling abroad, going on dates, trying every new TikTok trend, getting all cozy and playing games at the house. It was just a little taste into what life together could be like 
	and I'm hungry for more. I've known I love you for some time now, but at this point I can't imagine life with anyone else and once we're able I'm going to propose to you that's a given. And oh brother now that I can eat whatever it just expands the ever growing list of activities and
	places I want to enjoy with you. An every time I do something fun the thought consumes my mind of "the only thing that could make this better is if Riley was here". But I'm a patient man, no matter how long it takes I'm willing to pursue life with you until that dream becomes a reality.
